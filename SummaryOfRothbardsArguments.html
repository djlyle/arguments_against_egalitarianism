<h3>Summary of Murray Rothbard's Essay: "Egalitarianism as a Revolt against Nature"</h3>

<p>Here is a summary I recently compiled of the main ideas in roughly the same order as they appear in Murray Rothbards essay "Egalitarianism as a Revolt against Nature":</p>

<ol>

<li>Mankind should be freed from its enslavement to an inherently impossible, and hence, evil goal, namely the impossible goal of equality.</li>

<li>The logical implications of an egalitarian world is that individuality, variety and special creativity would be sacrificed on the altars of equality in the attempts to bring all potentially enviable qualities and attributes up or down to a general common denominator.</li>

<li>Egalitarian goals are often imposed and effected through coercion and force. The human spirit naturally resists such efforts to repress individuality.</li>

<li>Egalitarians are often blind to preexisting natural and biological ingredients that largely determine cultural norms even more so than any collective or individual attitudes seeking to establish themselves This sometimes leads them to falsely believe that culture can be changed by acts of pure will.</li>

<li>The burden of proof about whether society's judgements of group identity are proper or whether age old social traditions and norms are still worthy of respect and worthwhile to maintain for the benefit of society should always rest upon those challenging the wisdom of the ages and not vice versa.</li>

<li>Those who chase the false chimera of keeping egalitarian quotas all too often falsely assume that any and all group differences in status, prestige or authority in society must be the result of unjust oppression and irrational discrimination. This delusion appears to be due to the egalitarians having the preconceived notion that all people, and hence all groups of people, are deemed to be uniform and equal to begin with, otherwise disparities between such persons and groups wouldn't be seen as unjust. This egalitarian-quota thinking was put center stage in politics at the 1972 Democratic Party convention when the McGovern movement imposed a radical departure from previous party conventions by overriding the choices of the voters in order to compel the due quotal representation of particular groups considered to be underrepresented.</li>

<li>There are inherent differences, biological and otherwise, between the sexes which are important enough to have lasting social effects. Sex roles must be more than stereotypical indicators if they persist even in communities dedicated to equality such as Israeli Kibbutzim.</li>

<li>At the root of the women's liberation movement is resentment against the very existence of women as a distinctive entity.</li>

<li>It is no accident that some of the biggest promoters of bisexuality have been egalitarian intellectuals of the Left seeking to eliminate "artificial" distinctions between the sexes and make all persons simply and unisexually "human" in a society whereby all can reach their full "humanity" in a new ideal of "polymorphous perversity".</li>

<li>If human intelligence is largely influenced by congenital (inherited) traits, then any political atempts to provide economic equality for all citizens would only intensify the degree of socioeconomic differences caused by genetic variability.[In other words, egalitarian methods of trying to impose more equal opportunity for all could actually be creating just the opposite, whereas nature left to herself might have compensated for one's inherent deficiencies with good fortune in other areas.</li>

<li>In working against the natural flow of the universe, egalitarianism is unsustainable and fundamentally expensive. [Perhaps this is why public education programs like "no child left behind" create a climate of ever increasing costs]</li>

<li>In the spectrum of political ideologies, communism is one of the pinnacles of egalitarian expression while in contrast free market capitalism is one of the pinnacles of individualism. One of the trademarks of communism was the attempt to abolish the division of labor among people, with the end goal of education being the all around development and all around training of people able to do everything This vision of mankind would only be possible in the most primitive of societies where a lack of division of labor would leave such a society at a level of bare subsistence unless subsidized by another, more advanced and beneficient society.</li>
