<h3>Scriptures And Equality</h3>

<p>What about the scriptures and equality? Are they really touting egalitarianism or are modern men misinterpreting them to promote the egalitarian philosophies of the world?</p>

<p>One scripture that is often misquoted is 1 Timothy 6:10 which states "For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." Unfortunately this scripture has been seen too often through the dark glass of envy and the phrase "love of money" is inappropriately shortened into "money" in the minds of those who secretly despise persons of wealth for having something they haven't been capable of acquiring.</p>

<p>An initial naive reading of 2 Corinthians 8 might seem to justify the modern egalitarian mindset of everyone having equal portions rationed out and no one being any better off than anyone else. However closer examination of the meaning of equality in the biblical sense and the historical sense of the King James translation implies something far different from the modern day view of egalitarianism and its retro-worship of Communism derived dreams. Cross-referencing the account of the gathering of manna in 2 Corinthians 8:15 -- "As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack" with the account in Exodus 16:18 reminds us that "...they gathered every man according to his eating". In other words the people each gathered as much as they had appetite for, some more and some less and all were satisfied. It doesn't say that they all gathered manna, threw it in a communal pot and divied it up in equal portions to be rationed out.</p>

<p>So why does 2 Corinthians 8:14 mention equality? It was equality in terms of the moral ideal of each being just as willing to help another person in their time of need as they are willing to help you in your time of need as stated in verse 14:</p>

<blockquote>
"But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want, that there may be equality."
</blockquote>

<p>Given the context of the account of the gathering of manna in the wilderness as well as the verse preceding, i.e. 2 Corinthians 8:13, it becomes clear that the apostle Paul isn't advocating a redistribution of wealth to even out disparities of personal income and wealth. He is advocating that we have equal regard and sympathy towards our fellow man, especially in their time of need. Thus we should be willing to help those in need with our abundance. We needn't however feel guilt or shame for being more wealthy than others nor obliged to distribute our wealth amongst those less endowed with it.</p>

<p>The scriptures talk of God being no respector of persons. This doesn't mean that God considers all men to be equals nor that His law is meant to effect or impose equal conditions and outcomes for all. Similar to traditional constitutional law, the traditional and biblical demands for equality before God and one's fellow man meant that neither God nor man should actively attempt to disfavor one person beneath another except on moral grounds established by moral laws, where obedience to pre-established moral laws establishes divine blessings that aren't subject to mere whim. Hence God says "I The Lord am bound when ye do what I say, but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise".
Several New Testament parables have been misinterpreted to promote egalitarian views. One such parable is the parable of the day laborers that were each paid the same amount for different lengths of labor. When contrasted with the parable of the talents, it might appear that Jesus was preaching contradictory concepts. However when the parable of the day laborers is considered as a metaphor for the final judgement and how we might be judged not only for what we have done but what we have become by such actions, then it becomes apparent that since people aren't all the same, some might require more labor in the Lord's vineyard to become what God wants us to become.</p>

<p>Another misinterpreted parable is the one about members of the body of Christ and how one member shouldn't say "I have no need of thee." This isn't an analogy touting egalitarianism but simply saying that everyone deserves some respect. In a local assembly of saints, the pastor or bishop may still be more valuable and have a much greater responsibility and impact on the local church community as a whole than the church librarian or a Sunday School teacher. The librarian or teacher however might have greater influence on the people they directly interact with. All should realize that they have need of each other and beware of the pride of thinking themselves high and mighty and forgetting that roles, responsibilities and bearing of loads can and do change -- thank God!</p>
