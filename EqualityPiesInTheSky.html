<h3>Equality Pies in the Sky.</h3>
<p>I will attempt to explain why Isaiah Berlin was naive when he stated in his famous paper ‘Equality as an Ideal’ (1955/56) that equality does not need any justification, but only inequality does.</p>
<p>Distribution of equal shares of a resource is here purported to need no justification whereas unequal distribution of shares does. This might make sense, certainly common sense when the distribution is an active distribution of something that was made to be shared or which came to be assumed as common property. For example, it seems obvious that in a household wherein a pie was baked for general consumption, that the pie be divided up equally in order to be fair, but even then some members might not desire as much or have as big an appetite as others. So equal shares even in cases analogous to dividing up a pre-existing pie depends upon equal desire and equal capacity.</p>
<p>However life is rarely a case of sharing a bunch of pies or something analogous. Pie sharing activity implies that pie ingredients were gathered together, baked together, and the resulting baked good mutuallly desired. Real life doesn't consist of consolidating all independently acquired goods into one big communal pot and then hoping that the resultant mix is equally valued or desired. For example publicly subsidized child care is certainly not equally desired by taxpayers, especially those with no children or grown children. What was individually sought and acquired might be less appealing once it has been assessed as yet another ingredient in a massive pottage of "stone soup" Nor should one person's individual acquisitions have to be justified as an equitable portion of the "gross domestic product" formed by lumping everyone's wealth into some hypothetical gross quantity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the redistribution of wealth itself is unjustified, because it rests on the aforementioned false assumption that the current distribution of our cumulative wealth is only justified under the egalitarian lens of social justice ala pie sharing. Re-distribution is certainly an active taking of a portion of wealth or goods from one party or individual to another deemed as more deserving, especially when this portion being redistributed is seen as excessive for one party and lacking for the other. Yet such a presumption to re-distribute implies that the word "distribution" is necessarily a noun representing the current snapshot of a former act of distributing. As if some benevolent or not so benevolent hand, invisible or not, is responsible for distributing all wealth in the first place, and therefore needs to be corrected by a hand that re-distributes the supposed mis-distribution of things. The proper view of most distributions, excepting those that were deliberately and actively imposed, e.g. by confiscating and then dividing individual or group acquisitions, is that a distribution is simply a statistical analysis of the geographical location and spread of wealth amongst the population as they happen to be currently located. Thus goods are naturally located in non-homogenous packages amongst the population and land. The non homogenous nature is naturally the result of non homogenous needs, appetites, abilities and capacities that the egalitarians claim to consider but in reality deny by their incessant demands to fit all wealth into pie tins.</p>
