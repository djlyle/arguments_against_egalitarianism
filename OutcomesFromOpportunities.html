<h3>How does Opportunity Become Outcome? The Egalitarian Dilemma.</h3>

<p>I have recently pondered whether the goal of equality of opportunity and the goal of equality of outcome are really different and separate goals, or whether they are really the same goal where the ultimate culmination of the goal is prematurely terminated in the one case as opposed to the other. That is, could one view the efforts to achieve equality of opportunity as a kind of early term abortion of what would otherwise be a full term delivery of an undesirable thing when it is fully born out, i.e. the horror fiction full realization of equality of outcome?</p>

<p>Philosophically this ambiguity is related to the age old question of heaps and thresholds in general, i.e. when does adding yet another grain of sand turn it into a heap of sand? The concept of Fair Equality of Opportunity as opposed to simply Equality of Opportunity seems to define the concept of Equality of Opportunity as evolving into Equality of Outcome when fully ripened in philosophical notions of societal fairness in the platonic sense. If you search on the term "fair equality of opportunity" as defined by Rawls at the website:
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/â€¦">http://plato.standford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/...</a>
it becomes quite clear that no one knows where one begins and the other ends. Or one might know where one should end based upon one's own moral sense of fairness, but as a society and a body of individuals, how does that society and it's political powers know when to stop once it goes down the road of "fairness for all" and "fair equality of opportunity". Should fairness simply be based on merits and talents to the exclusion of inheritance and bestowing of gifts on one's posterity? The logical culmination of societal fairness seems to exclude one or the other in trying to establish socioeconomic fairness and equality for all. Yet what if a rich man has an imbecile for a child, a son or daughter whose inherited talents and intelligence fall far short of the father's abilities? Should that child be denied the advantages of his father's inheritance and wealth that might otherwise compensate for his innate lack of intelligence? How much should society sacrifice to help those who don't have positive compensation for things they lack? Can such sacrifice truly balance things out, if such a readjustment is even deemed ethical or warranted?</p>

<p>Or are all attempts to achieve a supposedly better and more fair playing field a revolt against nature as Murray Rothbard postulated? Does nature herself best compensate for inherent weaknesses and strengths by its natural diversity and often abundant complimentary forces? Are egalitarian efforts like the quota thinking and heavier weighted votes of supposedly underrepresented members of the Democratic Party convention of 1972 misguided when the McGovern movement brought egalitarianism forefront and center to the political stage? Is this what led former democrats like Ronald Reagan to declare that the Democratic Party had left them and not the other way around? Is this what Democrats really mean when they suggest more democratic processes in government, i.e. weighting some votes heavier than others because all men are equal but some are more equal than others (somehow more significant because they are proportionately underrepresented)?</p>
