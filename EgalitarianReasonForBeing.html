<h3>The Egalitarian Reason For Being</h3>
<p>Since I'm currently obsessed with pondering about the philosophical ramifications of egalitarianism here's another Gedanken-experiment:</p>
 
<p>Imagine a world where truly indigent conditions, e.g. hunger, thirst, poor living conditions, poor health care etc. were nonexistent but there were still differences in socioeconomic status, that is people still flying first class and people still flying second and third class but the luxury of even third class being the luxury of today's first class. Would the egalitarian ideal and the drive for equal opportunity have any rational basis amongst egalitarian sympathizers in such a world? Or would their rational basis be seen as merely based on envy? Or would it be based on an unfounded yet understandable fear that second tier citizens might become so disadvantaged that their inferior yet decadent lifestyle would decay into becoming truly indigent?</p>

<p>Upon further thought I have wondered how this relates to the situation where "poor" people spend an inordinate amount of their "meager" income on video games, big televisions and cars and yet still complain about their inferior socioeconomic status and inability to afford some of the real necessities of life after having squandered some of their income on nonessential things? Should they still be able to qualify for foodstamps if they have spent the rest of their income on non-essentials?</p>

<p>Let's go back to the general notion of inequality provoking envy even when everyone, though unequal, would otherwise be satisfied if they were unaware of others' superior status or position. How does this relate to civil unions and legal protections provided to faux marriages? While not afforded the same status and common law definition as traditional marriage, such unions satisfy all preexisting demands except the incessant demands for status based purely on envy towards real marriage of men and women.</p>
